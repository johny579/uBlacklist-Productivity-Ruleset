# uBlacklist-Productivity-Ruleset
Ruleset for [uBlacklist](https://github.com/iorate/ublacklist) made to boost productivity and minimize distractions - block AI slop, social media, gaming (except educational), SEO propaganda/fake news and erotic sites that show up even when SafeSearch is enabled. We recommend combining it with the FOSS [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) and [Stay Focused](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/stay-focused/nnlgodiccogbpcfnhmclaicljjgfmekd) extensions to maximize your productivity while remaining anonymous.
